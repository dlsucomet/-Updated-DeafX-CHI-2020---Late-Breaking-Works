abstract="Music composition is a delicate and disciplined art form that is tedious and repetitive. In this preliminary study, we explore the design of an interaction that aims to balance the work of composers with the help of a mobile application. The process of musical composition is not easy for composers. Certain tasks such as figuring out succeeding notes often requires trial-and-error, as well as knowledge of certain theories. Existing technology has employed musical metacreation to assist in this process. This endows machines with the artificial creative capacity to perform musical tasks. In review, the existing technology has not been generally-used in all stages of the musical composition process. By combining several interaction technologies, composers can benefit by being able to do their tasks with significantly less cognitive load and time.",

abstract="Several Sign Language (SL) systems have been developed using various technologies: Kinect, armbands, and gloves. Majority of these studies never considered user experience as part of their approach. With that, we propose a new framework that eases usability by employing two-arm gestural electromyography instead of typical vision-based systems see Fig. 5. Interactions can be considered seamless and natural with this way. In this preliminary study, we conducted focus group discussions and usability tests with signers. Based on the results of the usability tests, 90{\%} of respondents found the armband comfortable. The respondents also stated that the armband was not intrusive when they tried to perform their sign gestures. At the same time, they found it aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, we produced an initial prototype from this experiment setup and tested them on several conversational scenarios. By using this approach, we enable an agile framework that caters the needs of the signer-user.",

Improvements are made possible by a systematic and efficient design and code verification process, with well-defined roles for inspection participants. The manner in which inspection data is categorized and made suitable for process analysis is an important factor in attaining the improvements. It is shown that by using inspection results, a mechanism for initial error reduction followed by ever-improving error rates can be achieved.},

abstract="Personal computing applications are constantly increasing their potential power, thanks to steadily growing hardware capabilities and large diffusion of high-quality multimedia output devices. At the same time, mobile communication tools are becoming an integral part of our everyday life, with new advanced functionalities offered at an unrestrainable pace. Although the way we interact with information machines is substantially the same since 20years---based on keyboard, mouse and window metaphor---other communication modalities are possible, and shortly may become popular as additional interaction methods. Given the paramount importance of the ``interface'' in present computer applications, no alternative should be ignored, as it could greatly improve the quality of both interaction processes and user cognitive performance. Without pretending to foresee the future, in this paper we provide an overview of the main current technologies which can enable potential novel interfaces, discussing their features, strengths, weaknesses and promising applications.",

This article discusses the origins of Diletskii's treatise and its long-standing influence in Russia, where it circulated for one hundred years, the theoretical content of the work, and the complex relationships among the three surviving variants (from Smolensk 1677, from Moscow 1679, and from Moscow in versions from 1679 and 1681). Diletskii's circles of fifths, although certainly unknown to contemporary theorists, fit into a Western theoretical tradition centering on practical instruction using keyboard instruments.},

 abstract = {Recent theories suggest alternatives to the commonly held belief that the sole role of gestures is to communicate meaning directly to listeners. Evidence suggests that gestures may serve a cognitive function for speakers, possibly acting as lexical primes. We observed that participants gestured more often when describing a picture from memory than when the picture was present and that gestures were not influenced by manipulating eye contact of a listener. We argue that spatial imagery serves a short-term memory function during lexical search and that gestures may help maintain spatial images. When spatial imagery is not necessary, as in conditions of direct visual stimulation, reliance on gestures is reduced or eliminated.},
